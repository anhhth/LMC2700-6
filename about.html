                <p><strong>Welcome to my canvas!</strong><br>A computer can generate 16,777,216 colors, 
                and the human eye can perceive over seven million different colors. 
                Everyone is born a blank canvas, and each small 
                experience adds a splash of color to that canvas. 
                This portfolio presents a part of mine.
                <br>I am Anh Ho, a sophomore majoring in Computational Media at Georgia Institute of Technology. 
                I come from the gorgeous country of Vietnam, here at Tech to explore the culture, the people and the media in 
                a land all the way on the other side of the globe. I have always been fascinated by colors. 
                I have a passion for graphic design as well as for coding. 
                Before going to Tech, I taught myself how to do graphic design and how to code; 
                being at Tech is an opportunity for me to gain a more solid foundation and to learn much more.
                My major, Computational Media, is like the best of both worlds for me. 
                I intend to have Media and Interaction Design &amp; Experimental Media as my threads in my major, 
                as they align with my aspiration to pursue UI/UX design as my future career. 
                I am excited to see what new colors I can add to my canvas during my time here at Georgia Tech and in America.
